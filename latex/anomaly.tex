\section{Introduction}

% The first paragraph of a research paper is always the hardest to write. Just write and ideas will flow while writing. (Writers' block)

In our increasingly complex world, networks offer an abstract representation for organizing the relationships between entities of interest in a complex system. The entities are represented as nodes while edges connecting pairs of nodes represent the existence of relationship between the entities. Examples of networks pervasive in our lives are social networks \cite{Wu2004}, protein networks, computer networks, transportation networks, neurological networks, organizational networks \cite{Mihm2010}, wireless sensor networks\footnote{Internet of Things}, electrical networks, etc. 

In these complex systems, a functional network that facilitates reliable flow of information through the edges is necessary for the complex system to achieve its objectives. However, it is inevitable that complex systems are subjected to wear and tear, leading to occasional anomalous behavior in certain parts of the system. Anomalies in the system would disrupt normal operations, and prevent the complex system from meeting its objectives.

While critical anomalies lead to catastrophic failures and cause the complete shutdown of a complex system, it is highly noticeable by the stakeholders of the complex system. The anomalies are thus quickly identified and localized for corrections to restore the functions of the complex system.

A more challenging \textbf{problem} which we address in our research, is to recognize the \emph{non-critical} anomalies that would result in a lower than optimal efficiency of the complex system. Such non-critical anomalies are often \emph{ignored} and its \emph{location unknown}, since the complex system can continue to function without corrections to them. But non-critical anomalies that are not corrected could aggravate over time into critical anomalies and cause catastrophic failure to the complex system in the unforeseeable future. 

Before proceeding further, we would use the Figures \ref{fig:travel_graph} and \ref{fig:7} to illustrate the problem. Figure \ref{fig:travel_graph} shows a small network where information flows from nodes to nodes through the directed edges. The edges connecting nodes $\{a, b, c, d, e\}$ form a path for information to flow between them. We do not assume that $a$ and $e$ is always the origin and destination of every information flow, i.e. users of the complex system could choose any of the intermediate nodes $\{b, c, d\}$ as origin or destination of their information journey. The \textcolor{red}{red $- ~ \cdot \rightarrow$} line indicates the possibility of an existing anomaly that would disrupt the flow of information along this route.

	\caption{Information Flow in Networks}
	\label{fig:travel_graph}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{fig:7_start} and \ref{fig:7_end} show the histograms of information beginning its journey at the start node $a$, and ending its journey at the end node $e$. In the histograms, the x-axis represents the hour of the day, and each bin on the x-axis has a time interval of two minutes. The y-axis shows the number of journeys starting or ending its journey at the time corresponding to the timing of the bins. The phenomenon that we could immediately observe is that while the start node shows a \emph{regular} transmission of information, the end node receives the information at \emph{irregular} intervals. This could suggest the presence of an anomaly within the path such as the segment connecting node $b$ and $c$, suffering from a severe network congestion as shown in Figure \ref{fig:travel_graph}.

\end{figure}

We propose a \emph{non-intrusive} solution to early detection of such anomalies in the rest of this paper. Our proposed non-intrusive \textbf{solution} relies on \emph{temporal} data related to the \emph{flow} of information from an \emph{origin} node to a \emph{destination} node. Since the solution should be non-intrusive, we only require temporal information from the two (origin and destination) end points while assuming that detailed temporal information during the journey is missing or difficult to obtain.

We formally define our problem based on the assumption that the following logged data is made available for our analysis. That is, given a set of records $R$ for a complex system, each record $r \in R$ contains the following,
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Spatial: The origin node $x_r$, and destination node $y_r$ of information flow in $r$.
	\item Temporal: The time $t(x_r)$ when information flow begins at the origin and the time $t(y_r)$ when information flow ends at the destination.
	\item Cost: The distance $d_r$ from $x_r$ to $y_r$ traveled by the information, or the non-temporal cost incurred due to the information flow.
	\item The path $p_r$ taken by $r$. The path consists of the sequence of nodes that the information visits for it to travel from node $x_r$ to node $y_r$. In situations where complete knowledge of the network or path is not known, it would still be possible to infer the path based on the distance traveled and intent of the information flow.
\end{enumerate}
A pair of consecutive nodes $i,j$ in path $p_r$, forms a segment $s_{i,j}$. We determine whether the time taken for information flow in $p_r$ deviates significantly from expectation. For all the records $r \in R$ with observed time that deviates significantly from the expected time, we locate the segments $s_{i,j} \in p_r$ that are likely to be the cause of the deviations.

This task is challenging due to the lack of data on the time it takes for information to flow through the individual segments. We need to infer the expected time for each segment based on the set of available records we have and the limited amount of data each record contains.

Our technical contribution is the proposal of a model that performs the inference on spatial-temporal data where knowledge of the temporal trajectory is missing or not available. Such situations are common when it is not possible to install sensors in complex systems for monitoring the temporal trajectory. For example, in computer networks, the application layer only have knowledge of the two endpoints while remaining oblivious to the intermediate nodes. Another example is transportation networks, which only records the passengers boarding and alighting stations for the purpose of calculating their transportation fare.

%The inference is only possible if the set of records are diverse in their origins and destinations. We would elaborate the proposed model in greater detail in Section \ref{sec:model}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Traffic Anomalies Detection}

Pan et al. \cite{Pan2013} address the problem of detecting and describing traffic anomalies using crowd sensing with Beijing's taxis' GPS data and China's ``Weibo''\footnote{This service resembles Twitter but is catered for the Chinese population in Chinese language.} social media data. The anomaly which Pan et al. \cite{Pan2013} identifies is the deviance in traffic volume on segments of road during some special events. The detection of anomaly is relatively direct and the focus is on increasing the efficiency of the algorithm based on two special indexing structure for the detection algorithm.

Liu et al. \cite{Liu2011} proposed the discovery of causal interactions among traffic outliers. The framework as proposed in Liu et al.\cite{Liu2011} first partitions the geographical space into regions represented by nodes in a region graph. Edges between nodes represent the traffic flow between regions. Each edge in the region graph is differentiated within each time frame. By comparing the features of each edge across different time frames, Liu et al. is able to identify the outlier travel trajectories. From the detected outliers, an outlier tree is constructed with certain rules. In the outlier tree, each node represents an outlier trajectory. The parent of an outlier node occurs before in time and the destination of the parent is the origin of the child. The cause of the outlier, is the parent.

\cite{Ge2011,Zhang2011,Zhang2012} analyzed taxi GPS data to detect drivers who overcharge their passengers by deliberately taking the longer route to reach the destination. The general idea for finding these anomalous routes is to compare the route taken for each pickup and destination points and obtain a measure of how much it deviates from the usual routes.

Chawla et al. \cite{Chawla2012} proposed an algorithm to detect anomalies based Pinciple Component Analysis (PCA). Chawla et al. \cite{Chawla2012} represent the traffic data into two matrices, 1) the link-path matrix and the 2) link-time matrix. Then using PCA, Chawla et al. \cite{Chawla2012} is able to factorize the matrices into eigenvectors with its respective eigenvalues. The eigenvectors corresponding to large eigenvalues represent the norm, while those eigenvectors corresponding to lower eigenvalues represent the anomalies. Using these anomalies, Chawla et al. \cite{Chawla2012} tested their method to see if they could determine the root cause on synthetically generated data sets.

\section{Model}
\label{sec:model}

To find anomalies in the network, we analyse the set of information flow records $R$ from a complex system. But we must first determine which recorded information flow $r \in R$ is anomalous before we could proceed further with the localization task. A record $r$ is anomalous, if the observed time $\hat{t}_r$ taken to complete the distance $d_r$ deviates significantly from the expected value $t_r$ given to us by a statistical model.

\subsection{Baseline 1}

For our first baseline, we assume that every recorded information flow $r$ travels at a constant speed $c$ to cover the total distance $d_r$ required to reach its destination. The distribution of time taken $t_r$ for record $r$ is given by the following Gaussian distribution,
\[ t_r \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \frac{d_r}{c}, d_r \sigma^2 \right) \]
The unknown value of $c$ can be obtained by minimizing the following least squares error,
\[ \sum_{r \in R} (t_r - \hat{t}_r)^2 \]
Thus allowing us to obtain,
\begin{gather*}
	c = \frac{\sum_{r \in R} d_r}{\sum_{r \in R} \hat{t}_r} \qquad
    \sigma^2 = \frac{ \sum_{r \in R} \left( \hat{t}_r - \frac{d_r}{c} \right)^2 }{ \sum_{r \in R} d_r }
\end{gather*}

\subsection{Baseline 2}

The second baseline model which provides a more discriminative estimation than the first baseline is to assume a speed $c_p$ for each distinct path $p$ in the network.
\[ t_r \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \frac{d_r}{c_p}, d_r \sigma^2 \right) \]
The estimation for $c_p$ and $\sigma^2$ can be easily extended from the first baseline to obtain the following,
\begin{gather*}
	c_p = \frac{\sum_{r \in R_p} d_r}{\sum_{r \in R_p} \hat{t}_r} \qquad
    \sigma^2 = \frac{ \sum_{p \in P} \sum_{r \in R_p} \left( \hat{t}_r - \frac{d_r}{c_p} \right)^2 }{ \sum_{r \in R} d_r }
\end{gather*}
where $P$ is the set of possible paths and $R_p$ is the set of records that took the path $p \in P$.

\subsection{Edgebased Model}

We propose the Edgebased model, that models the speed of individual edges in the network. Given that an information flow record $r$ that originates from $x$ and terminates at $y$, the path taken by $r$ is denoted as $p_r$. Within each path $p_r$, the information flows through consecutive sequences of nodes. For every pair of consecutive node $i,j \in p_r$, the segment $s_{i,j}$ connecting the pair is associated with the known distance $d_{i,j}$ and an estimated speed $c_{i,j}$.

The distribution of time $t_r$ of $r$ is given by the following linear Gaussian distribution,
\begin{gather*}
	t_r \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \sum_{ (i,j) \in p_r } \frac{ d_{i,j} }{ c_{i,j} }, d_r \sigma^2 \right)
\end{gather*}
To estimate the variance $\sigma^2$,
\begin{align*}
	\sigma^2 = \frac{ \sum_{r \in R} \left( \hat{t}_r - \sum_{ (i,j) \in p_r } \frac{d_{i,j}}{c_{i,j}} \right)^2}{\sum_{r \in R} d_r}
\end{align*}

To estimate the speed $c_{i,j}$ of every segment $s_{i,j}$ using the observed time $\hat{t}_r$ of each record $r$, we maximize the log likelihood from each $r$. The log likelihood as contributed by $r$ is given by,
\begin{align*}
	\mathcal{L}_r &= \log \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi d_r \sigma^2 }} \right) - \frac{\left( \hat{t}_r - \sum_{ (i,j) \in p_r } \frac{d_{i,j}}{c_{i,j}} \right)^2}{2 d_r \sigma^2 } \\
	&= - \frac{1}{2} \log \left( d_r \sigma^2 \right) - \frac{\left( \hat{t}_r - \sum_{ (i,j) \in p_r } \frac{d_{i,j}}{c_{i,j}} \right)^2}{2 d_r \sigma^2 }
\end{align*}
We add a log barrier penalty to prevent negative speeds,
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:objective1}
	\mathcal{L}^*_r = \mathcal{L}_r + \tau \sum_{(i,j) \in p_r} \log c_{i,j}
\end{align}
By taking partial derivative with respect to $c_{p,q}$,
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:sgd_mean}
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}^*_r}{\partial c_{p,q}} = - \frac{\left( \hat{t}_r - \sum_{ (i,j) \in p_r } \frac{d_{i,j}}{c_{i,j}} \right)}{d_r \sigma^2 } \cdot \frac{d_{p,q}}{c_{p,q}^2} + \frac{\tau}{c_{p,q}}
\end{align}
The partial derivative allows us to perform Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) on parameters $c_{i,j}$ as follows.
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:update}
	c_{i,j} \leftarrow c_{i,j} + \eta \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}^*_r}{\partial c_{i,j}}
\end{align}
There are several interesting properties with the partial derivative in Equation \ref{eqn:sgd_mean}. The variance in the denominator shows that the more uncertain we are, the lesser the gradient is, hence less changes to $c_{i,j}$. The smaller $c_{i,j}$ is, the second component in Equation \ref{eqn:sgd_mean} will compensate by adding positive value to prevent $c_{i,j}$ from entering the negative region.

\subsection{Smoothed Edgebased Model}

To avoid overfitting the model parameters to the observed data set, we add additional constraints to Equation \ref{eqn:objective1} that minimize the difference between the speeds of consecutive segments in a path. This constraint is based on the assumption that consecutive segments have related speeds.
\begin{align*}
	\mathcal{L}^{**}_r = \mathcal{L}^*_r - \frac{\psi}{2} \sum_{(i,j) \in p_r} \left( c_{i,j} - c_{j,k} \right)^2
\end{align*}
where $c_{j,k}$ is speed of $s_{j,k}$ that comes after $s_{i,j}$.

Estimation for the variance $\sigma^2$ remains the same while estimation of $c_{i,j}$ is slightly modified,
\begin{align*}
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}^{**}_r}{\partial c_{i,j}} &= \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}^*_r}{\partial c_{i,j}} - \psi (c_{i,j} - c_{j,k}) \\
	c_{i,j} &\leftarrow c_{i,j} + \eta \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}^{**}_r}{\partial c_{i,j}}
\end{align*}
